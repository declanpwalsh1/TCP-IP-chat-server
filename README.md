This is the property of Declan Walsh as well as Rhodes College. While this project might be found by people who take Operating Systems
with Brian Larkins after me, this is meant for source material, not plagiarism.

To run the program, first compile it obviously, then you call it like so "./server -p 8000" you can choose the port number as you please
But you need to run the server first. It will wait for the client which is called as so "./client -p 8000" Then it should prompt
you to chat between the server and the client.
